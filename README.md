# ETH-XGaze baseline
Official implementation of ETH-XGaze dataset baseline.

## ETH-XGaze dataset
ETH-XGaze dataset is a gaze estimation dataset consisting of over one million high-resolution images of varying gaze under extreme head poses. We established a simple baseline test on our ETH-XGaze dataset and other datasets. This repository includes the code and pre-trained model. Please find more details about the dataset on our [project page](https://ait.ethz.ch/projects/2020/ETH-XGaze/).
